		<h1>What is DOM, Shadow DOM and Virtual DOM</h1>
		<h2>DOM</h2>
		<p>We can access them via the DOM API like this one document.body.p</p>

		<h2>Shadow DOM</h2>
		<p>
			Here we have custom elements like in the video tag such as the play button that is not accessible through the dom API
		</p>
		<video controls width="600">
			<source src="digimon_op_short.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		</video>
		<p>If you inspect the buttons of the video, you will see they are not available as an object of the DOM</p>
		<p>This video component is a custom component created by the browser through the Shadow DOM</p>
		<p>Chrome, for instance, does not show the shadow DOM by default, but you can enable them through its settings</p>

		<h2>Virtual DOM</h2>
		<p>DOM Manipulation is heavy</p>
		<p>
			Sometimes, changing variables them applying them immediatly on the DOM can be very slow, specially when nowadays
			modern frontend websites are JS heavy.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, to counter that, some frameworks create a virtual DOM, which is an abstraction of the DOM, where an ideal
			representation of the DOM is kept in memory than synced with the actual DOM
		</p>
		<p>React.JS is one of the frameworks that have a Virtual DOM to boost performance and cross-browser compatibility</p>
